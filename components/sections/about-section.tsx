            <p className="text-body">
              My journey started with a bootstrapped web dev agency in college with a friend, learning to write clean code and manage client projects. We were acquired by a marketing firm, providing valuable experience in fast-paced environments where I built custom solutions under tight deadlines.
            </p>
            <p className="text-body">
              I&apos;ve worked across various roles: <strong>Full-Stack Dev</strong>, <strong>Architect</strong>, <strong>CTO</strong>, <strong>Engineering Manager</strong>, and now <strong>Technical Program Manager</strong> at a global hardware company. Through this experience, I&apos;ve developed a philosophy that technical excellence works best when combined with strong team dynamics and psychological safety.

              Aside from my salaried position, I run <strong>Strong Hands, Soft Heart LLC</strong>, my personal umbrella for creative and entrepreneurial work:

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">Daily Practices</h3>
            <p className="text-body">
              I write almost daily—essays, ideas, documentation. I train regularly: basketball, weights, and martial arts. I cook whole foods and parent two kids. I&apos;ve rebuilt my life post-divorce and learned that presence and execution matter more than perfection.
